      # The builtin GitHub token doesn't have the "workflows" permissions, and

      # them, or push commits changing files in that directory.
      #
      # Another limitation of the builtin GitHub token is that commits pushed
      # through it don't start other GitHub Actions workflows, to prevent
      # accidental infinte loops. Still, that's not acceptable for us, as we
      # need to run CI on commits produced by this automation.

      # To work around both problems we're using a fresh token from an ad-hoc
