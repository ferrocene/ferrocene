      # The pull-subtrees automation needs to fetch from the repositories the
      # subtrees are based on, but since those repositories are private we need to
      # authenticate on GitHub Actions with some kind of credentials.
      #
      # Unfortunately deploy keys are not feasible, as a single deploy key can only
      # clone one repository, and git doesn't make it easy to use multiple keys for
      # different repositories. Personal access tokens are also not adequate as
      # there's no way to scope the repositories a token has access to.
      #
      # To limit the permissions as much as possible, we then decided to create a
      # GitHub App that has only read access to those repos, and we use that app to
      # generate a temporary token.
