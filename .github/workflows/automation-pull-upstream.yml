      # The builtin GitHub token doesn't have the "workflows" permissions, and
      # so it can't create new branches with the .github/workflows directory in
      # them, or push commits changing files in that directory.
      #
      # Another limitation of the builtin GitHub token is that commits pushed
      # through it don't start other GitHub Actions workflows, to prevent
      # accidental infinte loops. Still, that's not acceptable for us, as we
      # need to run CI on commits produced by this automation.
