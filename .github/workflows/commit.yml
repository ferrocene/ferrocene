jobs:
  # Job dedicated to running quick checks for each commit pushed in open
  # PRs and personal branches. The job must balance providing quick feedback
  # and providing useful feedback, focusing on catching the most common errors
  # as soon as possible.
  #
  # It's fine if this job only runs a small subset of the test suite: the full
  # test suite for all the supported targets will be run when bors tries to
  # merge the PR anyway.
