The FLS is a document describing aspects of the Rust language for Rust toolchain
qualification purposes.

It was created by Ferrous Systems, in an original joint effort with AdaCore, as
one of the prerequisites for qualifying `Ferrocene`_, a Rust toolchain qualified
for safety-critical environments. The FLS is compiled of existing Rust
documentation, but presented with a rigorous structure in order to meet the
requirements of qualification.

The FLS is not intended to be used as *the* normative specification of the Rust
language (see the `Rust Reference`_), nor is it meant to replace the
decision-making processes of the Rust project. Any difference between the FLS
and the behavior of the Rust compiler is considered an error on our part and the
FLS will be updated accordingly.

The FLS text is licensed under either the ``MIT`` or ``Apache-2.0`` licenses, at
your option. Individual files might have different licensing. Licensing metadata
is present in each file, and the full licenses text is present in the
``LICENSES/`` directory.

Acknowledging Ferrous Systems
=============================

The Rust Project would like to thank `Ferrous Systems`_ for `donating`_ the FLS
(formerly the Ferrocene Language Specification) to the Rust Project for its
continued maintenance and development.

As a brief history, the FLS is a description of the Rust programming language,
developed by Ferrous Systems and `AdaCore`_ in July 2022 as part of Ferrocene, a
Rust compiler and toolchain designed for safety-critical and regulated
industries. The FLS provides a structured and detailed reference for Rust's
syntax, semantics, and behavior, serving as a foundation for verification,
compliance, and standardization efforts. The FLS represented a major step toward
describing Rust in a way that aligns with industry requirements, particularly in
high-assurance domains. Ferrous Systems had been the sole steward of the FLS
since July 2023.

Building the specification
==========================

FLS uses `Sphinx`_ to build a rendered version of the specification, and `uv`_
to install and manage Python dependencies (including Sphinx itself). To simplify
building the rendered version, we created a script called ``make.py`` that takes
care of invoking Sphinx with the right flags.

You can build the rendered version by running::

   ./make.py

By default, Sphinx uses incremental rebuilds to generate the content that
changed since the last invocation. If you notice a problem with incremental
rebuilds, you can pass the ``-c`` flag to clear the existing artifacts before
building::

   ./make.py -c

The rendered version will be available in ``build/html/``.

You can also start a local server on port 8000 with automatic rebuild and reload
whenever you change a file by passing the ``-s`` flag::

   ./make.py -s

Checking links consistency
==========================

It's possible to run Rust's linkchecker tool on the rendered documentation, to
see if there are broken links. To do so, pass the ``--check-links`` flag::

   ./make.py --check-links

This will clone the source code of the tool, build it, and execute it on the
rendered documentation.

Updating build dependencies
===========================

The FLS uses ``uv`` to manage the Python dependencies used for builds. If you
change the list of dependencies in ``pyproject.toml`` they will automatically be
installed the next time you run ``make.py``. If you want to update the packages
in the lockfile, run::

   uv lock --upgrade
