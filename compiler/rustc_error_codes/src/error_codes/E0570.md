The requested ABI is unsupported by the current target.

The Rust compiler maintains a list of unsupported ABIs for each target.
If an ABI is present in such a list, this usually means that the
target / ABI combination is currently unsupported by llvm.

If necessary, you can circumvent this check using custom target specifications.
