//! Data structure used to inspect trait solver behavior.
//!
//! During trait solving we optionally build "proof trees", the root of
//! which is a [GoalEvaluation] with [GoalEvaluationKind::Root]. These
//! trees are used to improve the debug experience and are also used by
//! the compiler itself to provide necessary context for error messages.
//!
//! Because each nested goal in the solver gets [canonicalized] separately
//! and we discard inference progress via "probes", we cannot mechanically
//! use proof trees without somehow "lifting up" data local to the current
//! `InferCtxt`. Any data used mechanically is therefore canonicalized and
//! stored as [CanonicalState]. As printing canonicalized data worsens the
//! debugging dumps, we do not simply canonicalize everything.
//!
//! This means proof trees contain inference variables and placeholders
//! local to a different `InferCtxt` which must not be used with the
//! current one.
//!
//! [canonicalized]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/solve/canonicalization.html
