# The llvm-project monorepo is really big, and it takes around 45 seconds to do
# a shallow clone of the latest commit. During most of the jobs we need just a
# small subset of it though, wasting a lot of time cloning unnecessary parts.
#
# This script uses two git features to only fetch what we need:
#
# - Partial clones are used to do a file-less clone of the repository,
#   deferring the fetch of the individual files only when they're needed.
#
# - Sparse checkouts are used to only checkout a subset of directories instead
#   of the whole tree. Combined with partial clones this results in only the
#   files from those directories being fetched.
#
# The script is configured to only fetch the subset of the monorepo needed to
# do everything we need *but* building LLVM: building LLVM requires a big chunk
# of the monorepo to be present, and at that point it's faster to just do a
# shallow clone of the whole monorepo rather than using partial clones.
