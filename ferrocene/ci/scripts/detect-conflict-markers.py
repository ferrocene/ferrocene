# To avoid having to run it locally, and to make conflict resolution more
# visible, the automation to pull changes from upstream commits the conflict
# markers when a merge conflict occurs, leaving it to the reviewer to clone the
# branch and fix the conflicts.
#
# To alert the reviewer where the conflict markers are, and to block CI
# whenever those are found, this script lists all the conflict markers in the
# repository, and errors out if some are found.
