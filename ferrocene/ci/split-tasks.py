# We're using a script instead of manually passing job names and --exclude
# flags to x.py to avoid accidentally skipping tests. Otherwise we might pass
# an --exclude without actually executing the test in another job.

# If you are trying to exclude a step from being executed at all in our CI,
# avoid changing the script to pass --exclude for it. Rather, change the

# This way, customers building from source will also avoid executing the step,
# even if they don't rely on this script.
