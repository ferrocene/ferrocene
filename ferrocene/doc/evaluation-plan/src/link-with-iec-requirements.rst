Link with IEC 61508 Requirements
================================

[|iec_ref|] requirements describe two steps for Software Tool Qualification
(Part 3 - 7.4.4):

#. Planning of usage
#. Qualification of a software tool

In order to respect these steps, we'll manage five documents for this tool
qualification:

* :doc:`index`
* :doc:`evaluation-report:index`
* :doc:`qualification-plan:index`
* :doc:`qualification-report:index`
* :doc:`safety-manual:index`

The current document is the :doc:`index`. It provides information on how the
tool evaluation is done. The results of this evaluation are presented in the
document :doc:`evaluation-report:index` to justify the Tool Qualification Level
classification.

The :doc:`qualification-plan:index` describes how the tool is qualified (Step
2: qualification of a software tool):

* Tool description and architecture.
* Who is responsible for this qualification.
* Development process.
* Validation process.

The :doc:`qualification-report:index` describes the result of the tool
validation (Step 2: qualification of a software tool):

* Tool identification (version/name).
* Environment.
* Configuration data.
* Qualification results (Test Reports, etc.).
* Usage Constraints or errors identified in the course of this qualification,
  with mitigations.

The :doc:`safety-manual:index` describes the usage, constraints, and
limitations of the tool according to this qualification (Step 1: Planning of
usage + some result from Step 2):

* List of the potential errors with mitigations or workarounds.
* Description of the tool usage and other information (configuration data,
  environment, etc.).
