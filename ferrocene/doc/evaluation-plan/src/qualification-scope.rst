Qualification Scope
===================

The Ferrocene qualification encompasses the qualification of the
Ferrocene compiler's functionality as identified in the
:doc:`user-manual:index` and the :doc:`specification:index`

The Ferrocene compiler links to libraries ``liballoc``, ``libcore``, and
``libstd``. These libraries are evaluated and tested within the scope of
Ferrocene qualification *for compiler use only*. The use of these libraries
by end-use code is outside the scope of the current Ferrocene
qualification. It is the end-user responsibility to qualify these libraries if
they are used in their code.

The other development tools besides `rustc` are not qualified and are
distributed for convenience only. This includes but is not limited to:

* `cargo`
* `rustdoc`
* `rust-gdb`

It is the end-user responsibility to review the output of these tools.
