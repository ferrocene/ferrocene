.. glossary::

   Borrow Checker
       Uses the control flow graph to verify the ownership and borrowing system of
       the programming language.

   CircleCI
       CI platform used by the Ferrocene repository to run its tests and build
       its releases.

   Exhaustiveness Analyzer
       Determines whether the alternatives of a match expression fully cover the
       range of a type.

   Git
       A version control system that tracks changes in a set of computer files.

   GitHub
       Code hosting and collaboration platform.

   HazOp
       Hazard and Operability study. It is a process for analyzing hazards in a
       systematic way by applying guide words to each node of studied item.

   HIR Lowering
       Checks various correctness properties of the AST, and then translates the
       AST to HIR.

   Known Problem
   KP
       Ferrocene Known Problems contain the description and scope of the unwanted
       behavior, suggest workarounds, detection and mitigation strategies, and
       list the affected releases.

   Lexer
       A stream of characters that represent the text of a Rust program in order to
       produce lexical elements.

   LLVM IR Generation
       Translates the MIR into LLVM IR.

   Macro Expander
       Replaces macro invocations with the implementations of the invoked macros.

   MIR Lowering
       Translates the THIR into MIR.

   Monomorphizer
       Uses the control flow graph to instantiate a generic by copying its template
       and replicating its generic parameters with generic arguments at appropriate
       instantiation sites.

   Name Resolver
       Uses the expanded AST produced by the Macro Expander to determine which
       paths refer to which names, which methods are being called by method call
       expressions, and which fields are selected by field access expressions.

   Optimizer
       Performs inlining, machine-code layout, register allocation, and similar
       optimizations.

   Parser
       Uses the lexical elements produced by the Lexer to construct the AST.

   Pattern Analyzer
       Uses type information to determine whether a single pattern or a tree of
       patterns can fully capture a value.

   SSH Key
       An access credential in the SSH protocol. Its function is similar to that of
       user names and passwords, but the keys are primarily used for automated
       processes.

   SSO
       An authentication scheme that allows a user to log into multiple independent
       software using a single ID.

   THIR Lowering
       Translates the HIR into THIR.

   Trait Analyzer
       Pairs an implementation with a trait or a type by satisfying the various
       implicit and explicit constraints imposed by the trait or type.

   Type Analyzer
       Infers and verifies the types of expressions and values based on the type
       system.

   Upstream
       The Rust project, also referred to as "upstream", is an umbrella project
       that encompasses contributions from individuals and dedicated teams, and is
       sponsored by interested companies through the Rust Foundation.

   LLVM IR
       A portable high-level assembly language that employs a RISC instruction set.
