Setting up a local development environment
==========================================

Required software
-----------------

To develop Ferrocene locally, you’ll need to have the following software
installed:

* ``git``, as the version control system used by Ferrocene.

* ``Python 3``, needed for the entry point of Rust’s build system.

* ``AWS CLI v2``, version **2.9.0 or greater**, needed to interact with our AWS
  account. Note that most Linux distributions only include version 1 of the AWS
  CLI, while we explicitly require version 2.

Configuring git
---------------

You need to have an SSH key registered in your GitHub account to be able to
clone the Ferrocene repository. You can check out `GitHub’s documentation
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_ if
you don’t already have an SSH key configured in your account and your local
machine.  If you need to generate a new key as part of the process, please
follow `GitHub’s recommendations
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key>`_
to generate a secure key.

Once the SSH key is registered in your GitHub account, you need to authorize it
for the Ferrocene organization using your SSO session. To do so, visit the
`SSH and GPG keys <https://github.com/settings/keys>`_  page of the GitHub
settings, and next to the key you use on your work device click “Configure SSO”.
Finally, click “Authorize” next to “ferrocene” and follow the prompt to enable
the SSH key to access repositories in the Ferrocene organization.

Configuring AWS CLI
-------------------

To authorize the AWS CLI to access our AWS resources, you need to add the
following snippet to the ``~/.aws/config`` file in your work device:

.. code-block:: text

   [profile ferrocene-ci]
   sso_session = ferrous-systems
   sso_account_id = 886866542769
   sso_role_name = FerroceneDeveloper
   region = us-east-1

   [sso-session ferrous-systems]
   sso_start_url = https://ferrous-systems.awsapps.com/start
   sso_region = eu-central-1

.. Note::

   If you do not already have the ``~/.aws/config`` file in your local system,
   create a blank one.

   If you already have the ``[sso-session ferrous-systems]`` block in your
   ``~/.aws/config`` you do not need to add it again, as only one copy of it is
   required.

Once that's done, you can log into the CLI with the following command:

.. code-block:: text

   aws sso login --profile ferrocene-ci

This will open your browser (if that doesn't happen, click the link displayed
by the command). Authenticate with SSO on that page (if prompted) and click
"Approve":

.. figure:: figures/aws-sso-login.png

    AWS SSO log in prompt

.. Note::

   You will need to authenticate with AWS SSO every week. The Ferrocene build
   system will remind you to authenticate if you're trying to perform actions
   that require AWS access but you didn't log in that week.

Cloning the Ferrocene repository
--------------------------------

To clone the Ferrocene repository, you can run this command:

.. code-block:: text

   git clone git@github.com:ferrocene/ferrocene.git

This will take a while to complete (as it is downloading the whole history), and
will create a ``ferrocene/`` directory inside the current directory.

Configuring the Ferrocene build system
--------------------------------------

The Ferrocene build system requires a configuration file to be present at
the root of the repository, in a file named ``config.toml``. You should put this
content in it:

.. code-block:: text

   profile = "compiler"
   change-id = 102579

   [ferrocene]
   aws-profile = "ferrocene-ci"
   test-outcomes = "download-ci"

There are a lot of other options available: you can look at the documentation
for all of them in the ``config.toml.example`` file for further details.
