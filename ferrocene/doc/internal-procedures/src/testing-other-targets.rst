Testing Other Targets 
=====================

It's often possible to test targets other than your host tuple.

Windows and macOS hosts can test Linux hosts using `Lima <https://lima-vm.io/>`_ (macOS/Linux) or
`WSL2 <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_ (Windows). While Lima supports other
instruction set architectures, WSL2 users must rely on QEMU.

Additionally, Ferrocene supports testing a number of targets which are not supported by upstream.
When testing locally, special tools or configuration may be required.

In general, any "bare-metal" target listed in :doc:`user-manual:targets/index` requires special
setup inside a Linux based environment, native or one supporting nested virtualization (such as
Lima or WSL2.)

Host Setup
----------

Unless otherwise noted, all bare-metal targets are tested via QEMU on a Linux host.
On macOS, a tool like Lima or Docker must be used. On Windows, WSL2 must be used.

:target-with-tuple:`aarch64-apple-darwin`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install Lima, if you don't have it:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install lima

You can create a guest with the following commands:

.. code-block:: yaml

    mkdir -p ~/lima/shared
    cat <<EOF | limactl create --name=ferrocene -
    minimumLimaVersion: "1.0.0"
    images:
      - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/24.10/release-20241212/ubuntu-24.10-server-cloudimg-arm64.img"
        arch: "aarch64"
        digest: "sha256:fb39312ffd2b47b97eaef6ff197912eaa3e0a215eb3eecfbf2a24acd96ee1125"
      - location: "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/24.10/release/ubuntu-24.10-server-cloudimg-arm64.img"
        arch: "aarch64"
    mounts:
      # Creates a readonly folder in the VM at "~/host" that maps to the host home directory.
      # Note: "~" cannot be used, because it resolves to the host home path!
      # See: https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/blob/9e3334fdb5bceef60d23cf429ed9b9f4e76c853f/templates/default.yaml#L36
      - location: "~"
        mountPoint: "{{.Home}}/host"
      # Creates a writeable folder in the VM at "~/shared" that maps to "~/lima/shared" on the host side.
      # Note: the ending "/" on "mountPoint" prevents the vm "shared" folder from being nested inside the host "shared" folder.
      - location: "~/lima/shared"
        mountPoint: "{{.Home}}/shared/"
        writable: true
    # Configures ssh forwarding and sets a fix ssh port to connect from the host side.
    ssh:
      loadDotSSHPubKeys: true
      forwardAgent: true
      localPort: 50123
    cpus: 8
    memory: "8GiB"
    mountTypesUnsupported: ["9p"]
    EOF

.. Note::

    These commands will create a VM named `ferrocene` and a folder at `~/lima/shared` on the host that is added as a writeable shared mount point to the VM.
    The entire home directory of the host is also mounted as readonly in the VM at `~/host`.

Start the guest:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    limactl start ferrocene


Shell into the guest:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    limactl shell ferrocene

You can also point `Visual Studio Code's SSH extension <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh>`_ at it
by adding the following configuration to your default ssh host configuration file:

.. code-block::

    Host lima-vm
      IdentityFile "~/.lima/_config/user"
      IdentityFile "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
      NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
      GSSAPIAuthentication no
      PreferredAuthentications publickey
      Compression no
      BatchMode yes
      IdentitiesOnly yes
      Ciphers "^aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com"
      User user
      ForwardAgent yes
      Hostname 127.0.0.1
      Port 50123

You may change `User` to your user name and change `lima-vm` to a name that better describes your vm.
The vm name is displayed in VS Code when trying to connect via ssh.

.. Note::

    Ensure that the port is the same as set when creating the lima vm.

.. Note::

    This configuration is required if 1Password is set to manage your ssh keys, because 1Password functions as the identity agent.
    Otherwise, the generated ssh config by lima may be used directly as described in `Lima's usage guide <https://lima-vm.io/docs/usage/>`_.

    With `ForwardAgent` enabled, removing the ssh settings for `ControlMaster`, `ControlPath` and `ControlPersist` in lima's generated configuration might be necessary,
    in case you use the configuration directly.

Finally, ensure the guest is configured according to :doc:`internal-procedures:setup-local-env` as well as the :target-with-tuple:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` on this page.

.. Warning::
    
    It is recommended to not share ``build/`` directories between multiple hosts, both for performance and correctness. To avoid this,
    you should ``cd ~`` in the guest and clone a new copy of the Ferrocene repository into the dedicated guest storage.

    Please ensure you always work from the guest-local repository.

:target-with-tuple:`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setup WSL2, if you don't have it:

.. code-block:: bash

    wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu-24.04

Ensure ``nestedVirtualization`` is set in the guest ``/etc/wsl.conf``, here is an example
configuration:

.. code-block::

    [user]
    default=ana

    [boot]
    systemd=true

    [wsl2]
    nestedVirtualization=true
    
If you changed your configuration, make sure to restart the environment with ``wsl --shutdown``.

Shell into the guest:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    wsl
    
You can also point `Visual Studio Code WSL extension <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial>`_ at it.

Finally, ensure the guest is configured according to :doc:`internal-procedures:setup-local-env` as well as the :target-with-tuple:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` on this page.

.. Warning::
    
    It is recommended to not share ``build/`` directories between multiple hosts, both for performance and correctness. To avoid this,
    you should ``cd ~`` in the guest and clone a new copy of the Ferrocene repository into the dedicated guest storage.

    Please ensure you always work from the guest-local repository.

:target-with-tuple:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to have all the normal prerequisites from :doc:`internal-procedures:setup-local-env`
installed, as well as a few extras:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install qemu-user-static binfmt-support

.. Note::

    These packages must also be installed in the VMs used on MacOS and Windows.

Target Procedures
-----------------

Currently bare metal targets have a similar procedure for testing.

.. note::

   Currently, these targets use our *secret sauce*.
   This will eventually be an open source component, but for now, it's our little bit of arcane magic.

:target-with-tuple:`aarch64-unknown-none`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Warning::
    
    In a :target:`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` environment -- such as a guest on
    :target:`aarch64-apple-darwin` -- you **must** skip to the final step, running the tests using::
    
        export QEMU_CPU=cortex-a53
        ./x test --stage 1 --target aarch64-unknown-ferrocene.facade library/core

    Incorrectly configuring your :target:`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` environment using the other steps 
    will damage to the environment and result in "Too many levels of symbolic links" errors.

Install the necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu libc6-dev-arm64-cross qemu-system-aarch64

If you don't already have a ``/usr/share/binfmts/qemu-aarch64`` file, create one:

.. code-block:: bash

    package qemu-aarch64
    interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static
    magic \x7fELF\x02\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\xb7\x00
    mask \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff
    credentials no
    preserve no
    fix_binary no
    
Then make sure it's imported:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo update-binfmts --import qemu-aarch64

In order to avoid build errors such as "``--fix-cortex-a53-843419`` is only supported on AArch64
targets," ensure the following is in your ``config.toml``:

.. code-block:: bash

    [target."aarch64-unknown-ferrocene.facade"]
    cc = "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc"
    profiler = false

After, you can run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    export QEMU_CPU=cortex-a53
    ./x test --stage 1 --target aarch64-unknown-ferrocene.facade library/core

:target-with-tuple:`thumbv7em-none-eabihf` & :target-with-tuple:`thumbv7em-none-eabi`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi

If you don't already have a ``/usr/share/binfmts/qemu-arm`` file, create one:

.. code-block:: bash

    package qemu-arm
    interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
    magic \x7fELF\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x28\x00
    mask \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff
    credentials no
    preserve no
    fix_binary no
    
Then make sure it's imported:

.. code-block:: bash
    
   sudo update-binfmts --import qemu-arm

Now set the target:

.. code-block:: bash

    export TARGET="thumbv7em-ferrocene.facade-eabihf"
    # or 
    export TARGET="thumbv7em-ferrocene.facade-eabi"

In order to test this target, the build process will acquire a copy of our *secret sauce* from AWS. Ensure you're authenticated, following the section in
:doc:`internal-procedures:setup-local-env` if your environment is not yet set up.

Ensure the following is in your ``config.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

    [target."thumbv7em-ferrocene.facade-eabi"]
    cc = 'arm-none-eabi-gcc'
    profiler = false

    [target."thumbv7em-ferrocene.facade-eabihf"]
    cc = 'arm-none-eabi-gcc'
    profiler = false


You can now run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    export QEMU_CPU=cortex-m4
    ./x test --stage 1 --target $TARGET library/core
