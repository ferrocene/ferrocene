Working with the CI
===================

Ferrocene's Continuous Integration is primarily driven by a combination of
YAML, Docker, Python and Bash scripts.


Imitating the CI
----------------

Sometimes it is useful to imitate the CI to reproduce failures.

The Linux jobs on CI typically run in containers and can be almost exactly
reproduced. Mac and Windows jobs on CI cannot run in containers and are more
difficult to reproduce.

If you are presented the option, it's a good idea to reproduce Linux CI
failures first.


Installing Docker (with Buildkit)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You do not need to download or use `Docker Desktop
<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>`_ with Ferrocene. If you
choose to use Docker Desktop, install it as directed on the Website and skip
the rest of this section.

On Linux, install Docker and ``docker-buildx`` from your package manager. On
Ubuntu 20.04 and up:

.. code-block:: bash

   apt install docker.io docker-buildx

On some distributions, you may need to start the service with
``systemctl enable --now docker``. If you just installed ``docker-buildx``,
restart the Docker service.

On MacOS, you can use the Docker CLI connected to a Lima host:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install lima docker docker-buildx
   limactl start template://docker

After setting up the instance, Lima will inform you of how to configure Docker to
use it instead with Docker.

On Windows, it's generally recommended to do CI imitation within WSL2. Enable
WSL2 from an administrator Powershell if you haven't done so already, then setup
``ubuntu-24.04``.

.. code-block:: Powershell

   wsl --install
   wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04

From there, follow the Linux instructions above.


Using the Python virtual environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:

   You do not need to install Python, or modify your system Python.


Ferrocene uses ``uv`` to manage Python and dependencies. ``uv`` is similar to ``rustup``, ``rvm``,
``nvm``, or ``rbenv``. It provides a way for a project (Ferrocene) to depend on a specific version
of Python and dependencies, creating a consistent development environment across any operating
system or distribution it supports.

This is particularly useful on platforms like :ref:`aarch64-apple-darwin` or
:ref:`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, which do not always include modern versions of Python.

You can install it using the same script our CI runners use:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   ./ferrocene/ci/scripts/setup-venv.sh

This script installs an appropriate version of ``uv``, uses it to install an appropriate version
of Python, pins the Python version to your Ferrocene checkout, then creates a virtual environment
and installs the prerequisites.

If you find your virtual environment out of date, you either run the ``setup-venv.sh`` script
again, or run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip sync requirements.txt

Using ``uv`` you can source the virtual environment each time you wish to use it:

.. code-block:: bash

   source .venv/bin/activate

If you infrequently use Python scripts, or want to use them in a oneshot command, you can skip
activating the virtual environment entirely:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run $COMMAND

For example, to run our licensing checks you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

   uvx reuse --include-submodules lint

Or, to run the ``split-tasks.py`` script for debugging:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   uv run ferrocene/ci/split-tasks.py test

In CI workflows you should always use ``uv run`` for calling Python. In the case of ``x.py`` it
is not required as the script has been carefully written to work with most Python versions.


Using the CI ``config.toml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create the ``config.toml`` used by the CI, set ``FERROCENE_HOST`` to your host triple,
then run the ``configure.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

   CI=true FERROCENE_HOST=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu ./ferrocene/ci/configure.sh


Using the CI Docker images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker images used in CI can be found in ``ferrocene/ci/docker-images``. Each
image documents how to build it at the top of the ``Dockerfile``.

To build the most common image, ``ubuntu-20``:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $FERROCENE_REPO
   docker build --tag ubuntu-20 --file ferrocene/ci/docker-images/ubuntu-20/Dockerfile .


Reproducing CI jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most CI jobs are formatted similar to this:

.. code-block:: YAML

  x86_64-linux-dist-targets:
    executor: docker-ubuntu-20
    resource_class: large # 4-core
    environment:
      FERROCENE_HOST: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
      FERROCENE_TARGETS: << pipeline.parameters.targets--x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu--std-only >>
      SCRIPT: |
        ./x.py --stage 2 dist rust-std
    steps:
      - ferrocene-job-dist:
          restore-from-job: x86_64-linux-build

Jobs can only be reproduced on the host triple specified in ``FERROCENE_HOST``.
Ensure your host is correct.

If ``FERROCENE_TARGETS`` is different than your host triple,
update your ``config.toml``'s ``[build]`` section's ``host`` and ``target`` to
reflect that.

For Mac or Windows jobs, you can coarsely reproduce the CI by running the
lines in ``SCRIPT``, line by line if desired.

For Linux jobs, enter the Docker container specified by the ``executor`` line:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run --rm --tty --interactive --workdir /ferrocene \
      --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/ferrocene" \
      ubuntu-20 bash

Inside the container, run ``./x clean`` then run the lines of the ``SCRIPT``
of the job:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./x clean
   ./x --stage 2 dist rust-std

Preserving build artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to preserve your ``build/`` artifacts, it may make sense to
re-clone the Ferrocene repository inside the container or mount a dedicated
directory for ``/ferrocene/build``:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run --rm --tty --interactive --workdir /ferrocene \
      --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/ferrocene" \
      --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd)/container-build,dst=/ferrocene/build" \
      ubuntu-20 bash

Note that you will need to create the `container-build` directory in the host
system beforehand.

Sharing miscelaneous directories with the container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to share any extra directories from the host with the container you
can use a similar strategy as the one used to mount the ferrocene repository.

For example, if you want to share the host `~/.aws` directory configuration so
you can authenticate in the container, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run --rm --tty --interactive --workdir /ferrocene \
      --mount "type=bind,src=$(pwd),dst=/ferrocene" \
      --mount "type=bind,src=$HOME/.aws,dst=/home/ci/.aws" \
      ubuntu-20 bash

Remember that any directories mounted with the `bind` type must exist in the
host system beforehand.

Making changes to the CI
------------------------

Effort should be made to avoid tying too tightly to CircleCI. Ferrocene is
likely to change CI providers in the future.

Non-trivial ``run:`` tasks in the CI should be made scripts in
``ferrocene/ci/scripts/``.


Tooling Pragmatism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tooling chosen for our CI is not necessarily borne out of preference, but
practicality. If you are adding new components to the CI, choose practical
and simple over fancy and interesting.

Ferrocene's CI should, as a rule, be unremarkable, boring, and reliable.

In general, Python scripts are preferred over Bash scripts, as Python is more
portable.

New scripts should be written in Python unless they are trivial and only run
on Linux/macOS jobs.

Before attempting to fix a bug in a Bash script, evaluate if it would make sense
to convert it to Python. During evaluation, check for these signals that a bash
script should be rewritten in Python:

* The script runs in Windows jobs at all
   * ``bash.exe`` on Windows is problematic and has been the source of a number of
     bugs.
* The script calls ``shasum`` or other hashing related functionality
   * There are tangible differences between Linux, macOS, and Windows' Bash
     implementations.
* The script deals with ``.tar`` files
   * Windows' ``tar`` implementations (both BSDtar and GNUtar) are problematic
     with symlinks and slow, while Python's implementation has proven more
     reliable.
