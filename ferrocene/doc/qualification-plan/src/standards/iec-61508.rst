   * - 7.4.4.7.f
     - :doc:`Qualification Report - Test results <qualification-report:tests/index>`
     - test cases and their results for subsequent analysis;

   * - 7.4.4.7.g

     - discrepancies between expected and actual results.

   * - 7.4.4.8
     - N/A
     - Where the conformance evidence of 7.4.4.6 is unavailable, there shall be effective measures to control failures of the executable safety related system that result from faults that are attributable to the tool.

   * - 7.4.4.9
     - N/A
     - The compatibility of the tools of an integrated toolset shall be verified.

   * - 7.4.4.10
     - See items below
     - To the extent required by the safety integrity level, the software or design representation (including a programming language) selected shall:

   * - 7.4.4.10.a

     - have a translator which has been assessed for fitness for purpose including, where appropriate, assessment against the international or national standards;

   * - 7.4.4.10.b
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool Options <safety-manual:options>`
     - use only defined language features;

   * - 7.4.4.10.c
     - :doc:`Evaluation Report - Qualification method <evaluation-report:method>`
     - match the characteristics of the application;

   * - 7.4.4.10.d
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool options <safety-manual:options>`
     - contain features that facilitate the detection of design or programming mistakes;

   * - 7.4.4.10.e
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool options <safety-manual:options>`
     - support features that match the design method.

   * - 7.4.4.11
     - N/A
     - Where 7.4.4.10 cannot be fully satisfied, the fitness for purpose of the language, and any additional measures which address any identified shortcomings of the language shall be justified.

   * - 7.4.4.12

     - Programming languages for the development of all safety-related software shall be used according to a suitable programming language coding standard.

   * - 7.4.4.13
     - See items below
     - A programming language coding standard shall specify good programming practice, proscribe unsafe language features (for example, undefined language features, unstructured designs, etc.), promote code understandability, facilitate verification and testing, and specify procedures for source code documentation. Where practicable, the following information shall be contained in the source code:

   * - 7.4.4.13.a

   * - 7.4.4.14

     - Where automatic code generation or similar automatic translation takes place, the suitability of the automatic translator for safety-related system development shall be assessed at the point in the development lifecycle where development support tools are selected.

   * - 7.4.4.15
     - See items below
     - Where off-line support tools of classes T2 and T3 generate items in the configuration baseline, configuration management shall ensure that information on the tools is recorded in the configuration baseline. This includes in particular:

     - N/A
     - the identification of the tool and its version;

   * - 7.4.4.15.b

     - Configuration management shall ensure that for tools in classes T2 and T3, only qualified versions are used.

   * - 7.4.4.17

     - the functional differences (if any) will not affect tool compatibility with the rest of the toolset; and

   * - 7.4.4.18.b
