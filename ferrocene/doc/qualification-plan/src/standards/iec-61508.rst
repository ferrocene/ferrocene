   * - 7.4.4.7.f
     - :doc:`Qualification Report - Test results <qualification-report:tests/index>`
     - test cases and their results for subsequent analysis;

   * - 7.4.4.7.g

     - discrepancies between expected and actual results.

   * - 7.4.4.8
     - N/A
     - Where the conformance evidence of 7.4.4.6 is unavailable, there shall be effective measures to control failures of the executable safety related system that result from faults that are attributable to the tool.

   * - 7.4.4.9
     - N/A
     - The compatibility of the tools of an integrated toolset shall be verified.

   * - 7.4.4.10
     - See items below
     - To the extent required by the safety integrity level, the software or design representation (including a programming language) selected shall:

   * - 7.4.4.10.a
     - :doc:`Evaluation Report - Tool analysis <evaluation-report:tool-analysis>`
     - have a translator which has been assessed for fitness for purpose including, where appropriate, assessment against the international or national standards;

   * - 7.4.4.10.b
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool Options <safety-manual:ferrocene/options>`
     - use only defined language features;

   * - 7.4.4.10.c
     - :doc:`Evaluation Report - Qualification method <evaluation-report:method>`
     - match the characteristics of the application;

   * - 7.4.4.10.d
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool options <safety-manual:ferrocene/options>`
     - contain features that facilitate the detection of design or programming mistakes;

   * - 7.4.4.10.e
     - :doc:`Safety Manual - Tool options <safety-manual:ferrocene/options>`
     - support features that match the design method.

   * - 7.4.4.11
     - N/A
     - Where 7.4.4.10 cannot be fully satisfied, the fitness for purpose of the language, and any additional measures which address any identified shortcomings of the language shall be justified.

   * - 7.4.4.12
     - :doc:`Qualification Plan - Development process <qualification-plan:development>`

   * - 7.4.4.13
     - See items below
     - A programming language coding standard shall specify good programming practice, proscribe unsafe language features (for example, undefined language features, unstructured designs, etc.), promote code understandability, facilitate verification and testing, and specify procedures for source code documentation. Where practicable, the following information shall be contained in the source code:

   * - 7.4.4.13.a

     - legal entity (for example company, author(s), etc.);

     - configuration management history.

   * - 7.4.4.14

   * - 7.4.4.15
     - See items below
     - Where off-line support tools of classes T2 and T3 generate items in the configuration baseline, configuration management shall ensure that information on the tools is recorded in the configuration baseline. This includes in particular:

     - N/A
     - the identification of the tool and its version;

   * - 7.4.4.18.b
