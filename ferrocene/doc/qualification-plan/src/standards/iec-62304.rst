IEC 62304 requirements
======================

[|iec_med_ref|] does not specify its own tool classification, evaluation and qualification scheme. In Annex C.7 it references to [|iec_ref|] to be used for methods and techniques that are not specified by [|iec_med_ref|].
Therefore, for  rustc, refer to the :doc:`requirements table of IEC 61508 <iec-61508>`.
