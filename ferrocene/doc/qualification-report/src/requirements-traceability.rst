Requirements traceability
=========================

Our infrastructure automatically tracks the traceability between requirements
and tests, and the report is available `as part of the documentation package
<../traceability-matrix.html>`_. The report must show full coverage: when it is
not possible to test a requirement on a target, an exception will be listed on
this page.

Note that the reporting tool only considers tests that were actually executed
as part of the :doc:`test results <tests/index>`. Ignored tests are not
considered when determining the traceability.

Exceptions
----------

Some requirements are marked as not covered in the traceability report linked
above:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ID
     - Targets
     - Reasoning

   * - ``fls_2d6bqnpy6tvs``
     - :target-with-triple:`aarch64-unknown-none`
     - Procedural macros are only available on host platforms, while this is a cross-compilation target

   * - ``fls_4vjbkm4ceymk``
     - :target-with-triple:`aarch64-unknown-none`
     - Procedural macros are only available on host platforms, while this is a cross-compilation target
