Ferrocene 25.11.0
=================

This page contains the changes to be introduced in the upcoming Ferrocene
release.

New features
------------

A subset of the ``core`` library has been certified to IEC-61508 SIL 2. For more information,
see the :doc:`user-manual:core/index` and :doc:`core-certification:index`.

New experimental features
-------------------------

Experimental features are not qualified for safety critical use, and are
shipped as a preview.

* Experimental support has been added for ``cargo miri``, an unstable undefined
  behavior detection tool. Other than installation, usage is
  `according to upstream documentation <https://github.com/rust-lang/miri>`_.
  
  The package is available as:

  * ``miri-${rustc-host}``

* The testing facades used to test ``core`` are now available for customer use.
  On their respective target pages, the following targets now have an equivalent
  testing facade which can be used for testing:

  * :ref:`aarch64-unknown-none`
  * :ref:`thumbv7em-none-eabi`
  * :ref:`thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
