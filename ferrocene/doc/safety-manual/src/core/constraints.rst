.. id::  CORE_CSTR_0010_SUBSET

Associated requirement ID: :id:`CORE_AVD_SUBSET_001`.

The user shall only use the certified subset of the core library.
The list of the certified subset is documented in the `Certified core library API docs <../../certification/api-docs/core/index.html>`_.
Compliance must be proven by following :ref:`subset:Compliance with subset`.

Compile with panic abort
------------------------

.. id::  CORE_CSTR_0020_PANIC_ABORT

Associated requirement ID: :id:`CORE_AVD_SUBSET_001`.

The user shall always provide the ``-C panic=abort`` option to ``rustc``.

Only use stable functions
-------------------------

.. id::  CORE_CSTR_0030_SUBSET_ONLY_STABLE

Associated requirement ID: :id:`CORE_AVD_SUBSET_001`.

The user shall not use experimental functions in the certified subset of the core library.

Use matching version of the core library and rustc
--------------------------------------------------

.. id::  CORE_CSTR_0040_MATCHING_VERSION

Associated requirement ID: :id:`CORE_AVD_SUBSET_001`.

The user shall verify that the version of the core library and the version of rustc used to compile code match. This is ensured by following the :doc:`Installation Procedures <../procedures>`.

Verify macro correctness
