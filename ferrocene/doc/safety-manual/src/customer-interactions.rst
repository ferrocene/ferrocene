Customer Interactions
=====================

Interactions between customers and Ferrocene are primarily done through the
`customer portal`_. An "organization" inside the customer portal is provisioned
for each customer shortly after purchase, in which team members can be invited.

Support requests and bug reports
--------------------------------

The `overview page <https://customers.ferrocene.dev>`_ of the customer portal
includes the instructions on how to contact Ferrocene support. Note that the
level of support available depends on the purchased plan.

Obtaining Ferrocene
-------------------

Detailed instructions on how to download Ferrocene are available in the
:doc:`User Manual <user-manual:rustc/install>`.

Obtaining Documentation
-----------------------

Ferrocene comes with a comprehensive set of documentation. This documentation
is available at `docs.ferrocene.dev`_ (requires authentication with your
customer portal account), or can be downloaded along with the Ferrocene release
(in the ``ferrocene-docs`` archive).

Consulting Known Problems
-------------------------
