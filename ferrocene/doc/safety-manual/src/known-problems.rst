Known Problems
==============

Ferrocene's defects are categorized into the Known Problems (KP) database. Each
KP is described along with its workaround, detection and mitigation strategies.
Access to the database is only available to Ferrocene customers with an active
subscription.

Consulting Known Problems
-------------------------

The up-to-date version of the Known Problems database is available at
`problems.ferrocene.dev`_. The contents of the database are regularly updated,
as new problems are discovered or fixed.

An offline copy of the database can be downloaded by following the instructions
at `problems.ferrocene.dev`_. When consulting an offline copy, make sure it is
up to date.

Notification of newly discovered problems
-----------------------------------------

All customers with an active subscription that includes known problems
notifications can receive emails when new problems are discovered. The
customer's employees in charge of triaging new Known Problems must enable
"Functional Safety notifications" in the `notification settings`_ to receive
them.

It is the responsibility of the customer to be aware of new problems being
discovered (for example by subscribing to the notifications, or by periodically
monitoring `problems.ferrocene.dev`_) and apply the procedures described in new
database entries.
