Qualification scope
===================

This qualification applies to Ferrocene |ferrocene_version|, limited to:

* rustc |rust_version|, limited to the Rust language as described in the
  :doc:`specification:index`, and according to the requirements and
  restrictions outlined in this safety manual.

* rustfmt |rustfmt_version|, according to the requirements and restrictions
  outlined in this safety manual.

This qualification is restricted to the following environment:

.. list-table::
   :align: left
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Host
     - Target
     - Uncertified Libraries

   * - :target:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
     - :target:`aarch64-unknown-none`
     - ``core``, ``alloc``

   * - :target:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
     - :target:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
     - ``core``, ``alloc``, ``std``, ``proc_macro``, ``test``

   * - :target:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
     - :target:`x86_64-pc-nto-qnx710`
     - ``core``, ``alloc``, ``std``, ``proc_macro``, ``test``

   * - :target:`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
     - :target:`aarch64-unknown-nto-qnx710`
     - ``core``, ``alloc``, ``std``, ``proc_macro``, ``test``

The libraries provided are evaluated and tested within the scope of
Ferrocene qualification for compiler use only. The use of these libraries by
end-use code is outside the scope of the current Ferrocene qualification. It
is the end-user responsibility to certify these libraries if they are used in
their code.

User responsibility
-------------------

According to clause 11.4.2 of [|iso_ref|] part 8, the user shall verify the
validity of the predetermined TCL prior to the use of this software tool in a
safety-related development.

Furthermore, according to clause 11.4.3 of [|iso_ref|] part 8, the user
shall ensure the usage, the environment, and the functional constraints of this
software tool comply with its evaluation criteria or its qualification.

Additionally, according to [|iec_med_ref|], a manufacturer of medical device software shall 
consider the used tools in the software development plan (clause 5.1.4) and in their configuration item control (clauses 5.1.10 and 5.1.11).
Although [|iec_med_ref|] does not come with its own scheme of tool classification and validation, it recommends in Annex C.7
the usage of techniques, tools and methods as defined in [|iec_ref|].


Ferrocene is accompanied by the appropriate documentation to support this
process.
