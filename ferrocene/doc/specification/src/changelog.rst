FLS Changelog
=============

This page describes the changes that have been applied to the FLS itself to
address changes and new features introduced in each Rust release. Every item
listed in the "Language" section of the release note is reproduced here, along
with the change that has been applied due to it.

.. caution::

   This page is **not** an exhaustive list of all of the changes in a release,
   just the language changes that had an impact to the FLS. See the `release
   notes`_ for a full list of changes.
