# Ferrocene's shared Sphinx resources

This package contains the shared Sphinx resources we rely on for Ferrocene's Sphinx documentation
websites, rather than duplicating them into each site.

ðŸš¨ **The contents of this package are only meant for internal Ferrocene use** ðŸš¨

While this package is intentionally public and released under an open source license, breaking
changes will regularly happen, we will provide no support, and third-party bug reports or pull
requests likely won't be accepted.

The contents of this package are primarily licensed under either the MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses, at
your option. The package also contains files released under different licenses: check the header at
the top of each file, or use [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) to obtain a licensing summary.
