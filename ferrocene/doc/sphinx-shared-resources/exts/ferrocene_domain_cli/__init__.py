# This extension defines the "cli" domain, which contains the "program" and
# "option" directives. Those directives are used to document the CLI interface
# of the binaries we ship.
#
# Sphinx *has* builtin "program" and "option" directives, but unfortunately
# they assume that the name of the command line option is just the one that
# starts with "-" (for example "--crate-name"), but for our use case we want to
# consider "-C opt-level=<level>" as the "-C opt-level" argument.
