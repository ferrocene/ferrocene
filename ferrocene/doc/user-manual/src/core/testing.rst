Testing with the certified core library
=======================================

.. include:: ../../../core-certification/src/partials/pre-release.rst

When using the certified core library, run tests exactly how you'd run tests with the normal Rust core library,
by running ``cargo test``.

You can use uncertified code in your tests, but need to make sure that you're only
using code within the certified subset in production.
