Overview
========

This Manual describes the use of Ferrocene |ferrocene_version|, the |iso_ref|
and |iec_ref| qualified version of the rustc toolchain. Ferrocene is based on rustc
version |rust_version|.

This Manual assumes familiarity with rustc and the Rust language, and outlines
usage instructions specific to Ferrocene.

Structure
---------

This guide contains the following chapters: 

* *About Ferrocene* describes the requirements and process of installing and
  running the Ferrocene toolchain.

* *Using Ferrocene* describes how to build programs using the Ferrocene
  toolchain. This includes an overview on how to build libraries, executables,
  as well as mixed language compilation and system calls. 

* *Compilation targets* describes qualified (supported) and unqualified (experimental)
  Ferrocene compilation targets.

* *References* provides further support and information about other
  documentation.

Further Relevant Documentation
------------------------------

The Ferrocene documentation package includes:

* The :doc:`specification:index`, which describes the expected behavior of Rust
  as implemented by the Ferrocene compiler.

* The :doc:`safety-manual:index`, which includes usage and constraints
  guidelines of using the Ferrocene toolchain according to functional
  safety standards.

Further information about the Rust language is available online and maintained
by the Rust Project. This is a reference only and has not been verified by
Ferrocene engineers. An overview of the information is available
`here <../index.html>`_.
