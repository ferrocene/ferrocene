Overview
========

This Manual describes the use of Ferrocene |ferrocene_version|, the |iso_ref|,
|iec_ref|, and |iec_med_ref| qualified version of the Rust toolchain.
Ferrocene is based on ``rustc``, ``cargo``, and ``rustdoc`` version |rust_version|.

This Manual assumes familiarity with rustc and the Rust language, and outlines
usage instructions specific to Ferrocene.

The Ferrocene documentation package includes:

* The :doc:`specification:index`, which describes the expected behavior of Rust.

* The :doc:`safety-manual:index`, which includes usage and constraints
  guidelines of using the Ferrocene toolchain according to functional
  safety standards.

Further information about the Rust language is available online and maintained
by the Rust Project. This is a reference only and has not been verified by
Ferrocene engineers. An overview of the information is available
