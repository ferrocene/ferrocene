# This file defines all the files and packages that are going to be part of a
# release. If you need to add a new target supported by Ferrocene or a new
# package being distributed this is the file to tweak!
#
# ## Groups
#
# Groups are a collection of packages produced for the same set of targets. The
# name of the group is arbitrary and doesn't have any specific meaning. If the
# target or package you're trying to add would fit in an existing group, try to
# avoid creating a new one, unless it semantically makes more sense.
#
# ## Packages
#
# Packages represent individual artifacts or tarballs that are going to be part
# of the release. All these packages must be produced by CI in order for the
# release to succeed. Packages have a name, which is the prefix in the tarball
# name, and its subset, which will define the set of customers with access to
# that package.
#
# Packages containing documentation should also define the `docs-in` key, which
# contains the path inside of the tarball where documentation is present. The
# release process will take care of publishing the contents of that directory.
