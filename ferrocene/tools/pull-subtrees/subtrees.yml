# Syntax and format of the file
# =============================
#
# Each list item represents a subtree managed by this tool. Each subtree
# requires the path in this repository, the name of the repository to pull, and
# the name of the branch to pull from.
#
# Once you add the subtree definition here, merge the change in the main
# repository and run the automation to perform the initial subtree pull.
#
# It's possible to optionally specify actions that should be run after each
# subtree pull. Supported actions right now are:
#
# - "update-cargo-lock": regenerate the Cargo.lock after the pull.

#   after:
#     # cargo update -p libc --manifest-path=library/Cargo.toml
#     - update-cargo-lock libc library
