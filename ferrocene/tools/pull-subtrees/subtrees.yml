# Syntax and format of the file
# =============================
#
# Each list item represents a subtree managed by this tool. Each subtree
# requires the path in this repository, the name of the repository to pull, and
# what to pull (either `latest-tag` or `branch:$name`).
#
# Once you add the subtree definition here, merge the change in the main
# repository and run the automation to perform the initial subtree pull.
#
# It's possible to optionally specify actions that should be run after each
# subtree pull. Supported actions right now are:
#
# - "update-cargo-lock": regenerate the Cargo.lock after the pull.

- path: ferrocene/doc/specification
  repo: rust-lang/fls
  pull: branch:main

- path: ferrocene/library/libc
  repo: rust-lang/libc
  pull: latest-tag
  after:
    # cargo update -p libc --manifest-path=library/Cargo.toml
    - update-cargo-lock libc library

# Upstream currently tracks `branch:master`: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library
- path: ferrocene/library/backtrace-rs
  repo: rust-lang/backtrace-rs
  pull: branch:master
