//! Efficient read-write locking without `pthread_rwlock_t`.
//!
//! The readers-writer lock provided by the `pthread` library has a number of
//! problems which make it a suboptimal choice for `std`:
//!
//! * It is non-movable, so it needs to be allocated (lazily, to make the
//! constructor `const`).
//! * `pthread` is an external library, meaning the fast path of acquiring an
//! uncontended lock cannot be inlined.
//! * Some platforms (at least glibc before version 2.25) have buggy implementations
//! that can easily lead to undefined behaviour in safe Rust code when not properly
//! guarded against.
//! * On some platforms (e.g. macOS), the lock is very slow.
//!
//! Therefore, we implement our own `RwLock`! Naively, one might reach for a
//! spinlock, but those [can be quite problematic] when the lock is contended.
//! Instead, this readers-writer lock copies its implementation strategy from
//! the Windows [SRWLOCK] and the [usync] library. Spinning is still used for the
//! fast path, but it is bounded: after spinning fails, threads will locklessly
//! add an information structure containing a [`Thread`] handle into a queue of
//! waiters associated with the lock. The lock owner, upon releasing the lock,
//! will scan through the queue and wake up threads as appropriate, which will
//! then again try to acquire the lock. The resulting [`RwLock`] is:
//!
//! * adaptive, since it spins before doing any heavywheight parking operations
//! * allocation-free, modulo the per-thread [`Thread`] handle, which is
//! allocated regardless when using threads created by `std`
//! * writer-preferring, even if some readers may still slip through
//! * unfair, which reduces context-switching and thus drastically improves
//! performance
//!
//! and also quite fast in most cases.
//!

//! # Implementation
//!
//! ## State
//!
//! A single [`AtomicPtr`] is used as state variable. The lowest three bits are used
//! to indicate the meaning of the remaining bits:
//!
//! | [`LOCKED`] | [`QUEUED`] | [`QUEUE_LOCKED`] | Remaining    |                                                                                                                             |
//! |:-----------|:-----------|:-----------------|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0          | 0          | 0                | 0            | The lock is unlocked, no threads are waiting                                                                                |
//! | 1          | 0          | 0                | 0            | The lock is write-locked, no threads waiting                                                                                |
//! | 1          | 0          | 0                | n > 0        | The lock is read-locked with n readers                                                                                      |
//! | 0          | 1          | *                | `*mut Node`  | The lock is unlocked, but some threads are waiting. Only writers may lock the lock                                          |
//! | 1          | 1          | *                | `*mut Node`  | The lock is locked, but some threads are waiting. If the lock is read-locked, the last queue node contains the reader count |
//!
//! ## Waiter queue
//!
//! When threads are waiting on the lock (`QUEUE` is set), the lock state
//! points to a queue of waiters, which is implemented as a linked list of
//! nodes stored on the stack to avoid memory allocation. To enable lockless
//! enqueuing of new nodes to the queue, the linked list is single-linked upon
//! creation. Since when the lock is read-locked, the lock count is stored in
//! the last link of the queue, threads have to traverse the queue to find the
//! last element upon releasing the lock. To avoid having to traverse the whole
//! list again and again, a pointer to the found tail is cached in the (current)
//! first element of the queue.
//!
//! Also, while the lock is unfair for performance reasons, it is still best to
//! wake the tail node first, which requires backlinks to previous nodes to be
//! created. This is done at the same time as finding the tail, and thus a set
//! tail field indicates the remaining portion of the queue is initialized.
//!
//! TLDR: Here's a diagram of what the queue looks like:
//!
//! ```text
//! state
//!   │
//!   ▼
//! ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮ next ╭───────╮
//! │       ├─────►│       ├─────►│       ├─────►│ count │
//! │       │      │       │      │       │      │       │
//! │       │      │       │◄─────┤       │◄─────┤       │
//! ╰───────╯      ╰───────╯ prev ╰───────╯ prev ╰───────╯
//!                      │                           ▲
//!                      └───────────────────────────┘
//!                                  tail
//! ```
//!
//! Invariants:
//! 1. At least one node must contain a non-null, current `tail` field.
//! 2. The first non-null `tail` field must be valid and current.
//! 3. All nodes preceding this node must have a correct, non-null `next` field.
//! 4. All nodes following this node must have a correct, non-null `prev` field.
//!
//! Access to the queue is controlled by the `QUEUE_LOCKED` bit, which threads
//! try to set both after enqueuing themselves to eagerly add backlinks to the
//! queue, which drastically improves performance, and after unlocking the lock
//! to wake the next waiter(s). This is done atomically at the same time as the
//! enqueuing/unlocking operation. The thread releasing the `QUEUE_LOCK` bit
//! will check the state of the lock and wake up waiters as appropriate. This
//! guarantees forward-progress even if the unlocking thread could not acquire
//! the queue lock.
//!
//! ## Memory orderings
//!
//! To properly synchronize changes to the data protected by the lock, the lock
//! is acquired and released with [`Acquire`] and [`Release`] ordering, respectively.
//! To propagate the initialization of nodes, changes to the queue lock are also
//! performed using these orderings.
