#![unstable(feature = "thread_local_internals", reason = "should not be necessary", issue = "none")]

// There are three thread-local implementations: "static", "fast", "OS".
// The "OS" thread local key type is accessed via platform-specific API calls and is slow, while the
// "fast" key type is accessed via code generated via LLVM, where TLS keys are set up by the linker.
// "static" is for single-threaded platforms where a global static is sufficient.
