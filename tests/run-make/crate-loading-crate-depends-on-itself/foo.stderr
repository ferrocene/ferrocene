error[E0277]: the trait bound `foo::Struct: Trait` is not satisfied because the trait comes from a different crate version
  --> foo-current.rs:13:19
   |
13 |     check_trait::<foo::Struct>();
   |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `Trait` is not implemented for `foo::Struct`
   |
note: there are multiple different versions of crate `foo` in the dependency graph
  --> foo-current.rs:7:1
   |
4  | extern crate foo;
   | ----------------- one version of crate `foo` is used here, as a direct dependency of the current crate
5  |
6  | pub struct Struct;
   | ----------------- this type implements the required trait
7  | pub trait Trait {}
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the required trait
   |
  ::: foo-prev.rs:X:Y
   |
4  | pub struct Struct;
   | ----------------- this type doesn't implement the required trait
5  | pub trait Trait {}
   | --------------- this is the found trait
   = note: two types coming from two different versions of the same crate are different types even if they look the same
   = help: you can use `cargo tree` to explore your dependency tree
