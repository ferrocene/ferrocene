// This test verifies that rustdoc doesn't ICE when it encounters an IO error
// while generating files. Ideally this would be a rustdoc-ui test, so we could
// verify the error message as well.
//
// It operates by creating a temporary directory and modifying its
// permissions so that it is not writable. We have to take special care to set
// the permissions back to normal so that it's able to be deleted later.

// FIXME: The riscv64gc-gnu and armhf-gnu build containers run as root,
// and can always write into `inaccessible/tmp`. Ideally, these docker
// containers would use a non-root user, but this leads to issues with
// `mkfs.ext4 -d`, as well as mounting a loop device for the rootfs.
//@ ignore-windows - the `set_readonly` functions doesn't work on folders.
