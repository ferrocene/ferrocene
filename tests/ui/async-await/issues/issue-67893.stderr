   = help: within `impl Future<Output = ()>`, the trait `Send` is not implemented for `MutexGuard<'_, ()>`
note: future is not `Send` as this value is used across an await

   |        -----------------  ^^^^^- `x.lock().unwrap()` is later dropped here
   |        |                  |
   |        |                  await occurs here, with `x.lock().unwrap()` maybe used later
   |        has type `MutexGuard<'_, ()>` which is not `Send`
note: required by a bound in `g`
