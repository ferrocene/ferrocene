   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!

   = note: impls that are not considered to overlap may be considered to overlap in the future
   = note: `Interval<_>: PartialOrd` may be considered to hold in future releases, causing the impls to overlap
