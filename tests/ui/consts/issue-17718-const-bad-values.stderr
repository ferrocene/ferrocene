   = note: this will be a hard error in the 2024 edition
   = note: this mutable reference has lifetime `'static`, but if the static gets accessed (read or written) by any other means, or any other reference is created, then any further use of this mutable reference is Undefined Behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` on by default
help: use `addr_of_mut!` instead to create a raw pointer
