   |                               ^^^^^^^ shared reference to mutable static

   = note: for more information, see issue #114447 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114447>
   = note: this will be a hard error in the 2024 edition
   = note: this shared reference has lifetime `'static`, but if the static ever gets mutated, or a mutable reference is created, then any further use of this shared reference is Undefined Behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` on by default
help: use `addr_of!` instead to create a raw pointer
