   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#macro-extended-temporary-scopes>
   = note: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value
   = note: some temporaries were previously incorrectly lifetime-extended since Rust 1.89 in formatting macros, and since Rust 1.88 in `pin!()`
