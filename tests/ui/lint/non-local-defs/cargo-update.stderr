warning: non-local `impl` definition, `impl` blocks should be written at the same level as their item
  --> $DIR/cargo-update.rs:19:1
   |
LL | non_local_macro::non_local_impl!(LocalStruct);
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   | |
   | `LocalStruct` is not local
   | `Debug` is not local
   | move the `impl` block outside of this constant `_IMPL_DEBUG`
   |
   = note: `impl` may be usable in bounds, etc. from outside the expression, which might e.g. make something constructible that previously wasn't, because it's still on a publicly-visible type
   = note: an `impl` is never scoped, even when it is nested inside an item, as it may impact type checking outside of that item, which can be the case if neither the trait or the self type are at the same nesting level as the `impl`
   = note: the macro `non_local_macro::non_local_impl` may come from an old version of the `non_local_macro` crate, try updating your dependency with `cargo update -p non_local_macro`
   = note: items in an anonymous const item (`const _: () = { ... }`) are treated as in the same scope as the anonymous const's declaration
   = note: this lint may become deny-by-default in the edition 2024 and higher, see the tracking issue <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/120363>
note: the lint level is defined here
