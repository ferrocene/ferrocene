error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: const Foo` is not satisfied

note: required by a bound in `equals_self`

LL | const fn equals_self<T: ~const Foo>(t: &T) -> bool {
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `equals_self`
help: consider introducing a `where` clause, but there might be an alternative better way to express this requirement
