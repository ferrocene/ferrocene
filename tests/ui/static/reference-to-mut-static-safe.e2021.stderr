   = note: this will be a hard error in the 2024 edition
   = note: this shared reference has lifetime `'static`, but if the static ever gets mutated, or a mutable reference is created, then any further use of this shared reference is Undefined Behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_refs)]` on by default
help: use `addr_of!` instead to create a raw pointer
