//! This tries to prove the APIT's bounds in a canonical query,
//! which doesn't know anything about the defining scope of either
//! opaque type and thus makes a random choice as to which opaque type
//! becomes the hidden type of the other. When we leave the canonical
//! query, we attempt to actually check the defining anchor, but now we
//! have a situation where the RPIT gets constrained outside its anchor.
